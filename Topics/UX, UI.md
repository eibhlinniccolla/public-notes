            - User Journeys
                - What is a User Journey?
                    - Refers to the scenarios in which the user interacts with the product
                    - normally the scenarios consist of between 4 and 12 steps.
                    - Its function is mainly to assume and demonstrate the current and possible way in which the user can interact with the product.
                - User Journey vs. User Flow
                    - User Journey
                        - focuses on the UX of the entire process
                        - considers all stages from discovery of the product to completion of goal
                    - User Flow
                        - focuses on the individual stages of using the product.
                        - takes place entirely within the product

            - Site Maps
                - What is a Site Map?
                    - Gives you a visual representation of the product's organization and how different sections are linked together.
                    - Made up of sections containing other sections or content nodes, which make up an atomic unit of content.
                - Why make sitemaps?
                    - They show how the navigation should be structured
                    - They help identify where content will sit and what needs to be produced
                    - They help show the relationship between different pages
                    - Validate assumptions about scope and complexity, and provide a structure upon which to begin estimates for development
                    - They are the first tangible deliverable showing what you will be creating
                    - Allow stakeholders to confirm the direction of the product and that goals are being represented
                - Creating sitemaps
                    - Process
                        - identify the entry point
                        - Use sticky notes and list all categories and subcategories, based on your feature list or requirements.
                        - Start moving sticky notes around and create groups of categories and sub categories, think about the labeling from your users perspective.
                        - Create visual representation on paper or in sketch
                        - Test your sitemap with your users using [card sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html) technique to ensure that your sitemap will be findable and usable.
                    - Tips
                        - Make sure that all sub-sections and sub-pages are present
                        - Include clear expression of primary navigation

            - Project Development
                - Provide a breakdown of the intended scope of the work and recommended services you can provide

    - What is IA?
        - _The art and science of organizing and labeling websites, intranets, online communities, and software to support findability and usability._ — The Information Architecture Institute
        - Donna Spencer
            1. Organizing content or objects.
            2. Describing them clearly.
            3. Providing ways for people to get to them.
    - IA vs. User Flow
        - IA improves **Findability**, User Flow improves **Intuitiveness**
        - In **content-focused** projects, IA is more important, whereas in **interaction-focused** projects, User Flow is more important.

        - [User Flows](https://dynalist.io/d/b6UNZqlwC5YtebEJlIWQjtNP#z=dwFms7wi3HueGHOCEpSO8ODG)
            - big picture view of your product

            - the structure of pages on your product
- User Flow
    - What is user flow
        - The steps that your user will take in order to achieve a certain goal using your product.
        - starts with a goal the user can achieve while using your product and ends when the user successfully achieved this goal
        - Consists of:
            - ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8l2V2KDmfXVoDOjfRa5PzQ.png)
            - a number of steps each with
                - a view (What the user sees)
                - a number of actions (What the user can do).
    - Place in design process
        - User flows should be written before designing interfaces
    - Writing user flows
        - focus on listing the actions that can be done in a certain view without thinking of their layout or look.
        - Your user flow must have first a goal that the user will achieve
        - Steps
            1. Identify the goal that your user needs to achieve.
            2. Begin with the first step (Entry point(s)) 
            3. Continue moving step by step until achieving the user goal.
- Wireframes
    - Purpose of a wireframe
        - Show the content and functionality of the pages before any furhter designs
        - Help designer communicate with client about design concept
        - Establish information hierarchy
    - Elements of a wireframe
        - Information design
            - Design of main information, outlining structure and layout
        - Navigation design
            - Design of global and secondary navigation
        - Interface design
            - Design of visuals and user interface
    - Why wireframe
        - Much easier to understand than abstract concept design
        - Can be used to receive feedback
            - Makes design process iterative
        - Help define website features
            - Ensures page content and functionality are designed based on business needs
        - Fast to build and low cost
    - Wireframe process
        - Start with a physical sketch
        - Use black sharpie pen for lines, colored sharpie pen for shading, and highlighter for accent colors
        - Use placeholders instead of real UI elements
        - Annotate your wireframes
        - Record wireframes by taking a picture of them and storing them digitally
