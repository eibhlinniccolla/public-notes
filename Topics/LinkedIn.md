- Connections
- General
    - Your goals with LinkedIn are to:
        - Show up in a search with the right keywords
        - Stand out in search results
        - Signal that you are qualified and motivated
    - keep in mind the 3-30-180 rule
        - Recruiters take 3 seconds to decide whether to stay on your profile
        - 30 seconds for the first read
        - 180 seconds to decide on whether to contact you.
    - Get your profile to 100%
        - Profile picture
        - Location and industry
        - Experience (a current position, with a brief description, plus two previous positions)
        - Skills (at least three)
        - Education
        - At least 50 connections
    - Keywords are _really_ important
        - emphasize the specific things you want to work with, such as particular languages and frameworks.
        - remove skills and technologies you are not interested in working with. Or at least de-emphasize them.
    - Order your sections to draw attention to your most impressive experience
    - Hide the “People Also Viewed” box on your sidebar
    - join “Groups” and follow “Companies” that peak your interests
    - Your profile should embody more than just the work you have done, but also, the multifaceted portrait of your professional ambitions, passions, and unique talents.
- Cover Photo
    - GREAT:
        - Landscape photography
        - A clean picture of your office building or city
        - Industry related: Art for artists, CPUs for hardware engineers, solar panels for clean energy professionals
    - BAD:
        - Abstract, colorful art that might be perceived as tacky (if you’re not an artist)
        - Low-resolution photography of anything
        - Your office if it’s dull and grey
        - Your workstation
- Profile Picture
    - Pick a picture where you’re smiling or laughing.
    - 60% or more of the photo should be your face.
    - Professional is good, but a dark grey background is boring. Don’t be afraid to show off your personality a little while keeping things professional.
    - Don’t cover your eyes with sunglasses
- Headline
    - Add Your Specialty
        - To jazz up your headline, weave in your specialty.
    - Incorporate Your Future Job
        - To show up higher in relevant searches, add the job you want, not the job you have.
    - Include What You Do
        - Highlight your professional value by incorporating how you make an impact. 
    - Show Off Your Accolades
        - People will both impressed and intrigued by a headline that name drops. (Yes, name-dropping is totally OK in this situation.)
- Summary section
    - This should be in paragraph form – 3 paragraphs or less.
    - The summary tells the story of who you are – so use this blank space as a chance to highlight your resume and provide insight into your aspirations.
    - Include a call-to-action
        - The best place to do this is in the summary section.
        - Here are some examples of a CTA you can use:
            - Feel free to contact me directly at name@example.com.
            - Check out some of my design samples at portfolioname.com.
            - See my Github repositories at mygithubprofile.com.
    - Show personality and write in 1st person.
    - Tell a story in reverse chronological order. Begin with who you are now, including ambition.
    - Hit the keywords that are important: skills, tools, processes, etc.
    - At the end add links to your website/blog/projects/etc.
    - Find a way to make sure the first couple of lines make someone wanna read the rest and click read more
- Skills
    - Be direct and avoiding redundancy.
    - Organize your top 3 skills to highlight your expertise and direction -- do not just default to the top skills your friends endorsed you for.
    - Once you’ve organized your top 3 skills, ask friends to endorse you for them. Just send a simple message on Facebook or a text message. Be wary that doing this process with co-workers may make them feel you’re about to leave your company.
- Education
    - You only need to include high school if you’re under 20 years old and have no college experience.
    - Extracurricular activities are a nice to have. If you’re already an experienced professional, they won’t matter unless the activity is in your industry.
    - Remove the year you graduated from college
- Experience
    -  Highlight transferable skills
        - Communication skills, which can include writing, negotiating, presenting, and teaching/mentoring.
        - Teamwork or collaboration. Show you know this by mentioning collaboration tools you’ve used, give examples of ways you’ve worked with clients or teams, etc.
        - Planning and organization skills mean you are organized in thought, communication, and workflow. Demonstrate this by showing processes you’ve developed.
        - Ability to manage multiple responsibilities means you can multitask without getting stressed, rank your priorities, and stay disciplined.
        - Problem-solving skills means you can troubleshoot issues in new ways.
    - this isn’t about telling people about everything you’ve done. It’s about highlighting your most impressive accomplishments.
    - Stick to writing in mostly bullet points. A brief overview before bullet points is ok.
    - Keep each bullet point to 1-2 sentences, and keep them short.
    - Write sentences in the RMAC or ACR format “[ACTION] on [CONTEXT], resulting in [RESULT]”
    - When a [RESULT] can contain a metric or number that makes sense, use it. This may take research -- but it’s worth it. If you can’t think of an improvement metric, you can always talk about time, ie “Retrofitted multi-million dollar kitchen with modern IoT technology in just 3 days, saving the customer 40% compared to competition.”
    - For your current job, aim for 5-7 bullet points. For past experience, 3-5 is ideal. People don’t want to read a book.
    - Try to avoid:
        - Large paragraphs of text
        - Hashtags -- this isn’t Twitter
        - Talking poorly about any past jobs
- Recommendations
    - If you have more than a year of work experience, you need a recommendation -- even if you’re a student, it’s smart to get a recommendation from a fellow classmate.
    - When you ask friends, co-workers, or past co-workers for a recommendation, make sure they know your goals and ambition.
    - Once you hit 2 recommendations, you don’t need many more. The more, the better, but quality is everything.
    - If you get a recommendation that you feel is of low quality, choose to hide it. Don’t worry about your friend’s feelings -- mediocre reviews will hurt you.
    - Ask people to highlight skills you want to focus on in their recommendations
- Projects
    - Show examples of your work
    - Show the process from idea to draft to finished product, or describe this process
- Interests
    - follow influencers and companies in your industry, and then not dilute them too much with groups that don’t fit your background.
