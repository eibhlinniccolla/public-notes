- Philosophy of Coercion #project-management/story
    - You should adopt a coding style that makes value types plain and obvious
    - Make sure that the types involved in every operation are clear, so corner cases are safely managed
        - Don't write insane polymorphic functions that can take any input and do 15 different things
    - When writing code comments, focus on the **why** rather than the **how** or **what**
    - Implicitness is _abstraction_, not _magic_
        - Hiding unnecessary details
    - Ultimate question: Is showing the reader the extra type details helpful or distracting?
    - Useful: when the reader is focused on what's important
    - Dangerous: when ther reader can't tell what will happen
    - Better: when the reader understands the code
    - It is irresponsible to knowingly avoid usage of a feature that can improve code readability
- When writing JS code, make it obvious what the types are
- You should be able to use `==` without fear, because the reader of the code knows what the types are and whether coercion is okay
- When making comparisons, always make a decision as to whether coercion is helpful or not
