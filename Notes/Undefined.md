- `undefined`
    - `undefined` does NOT mean that a variable doesn't have a value; it does, and its value is `undefined`
    - `undefined` IS a value
    - `undefined` is both a type, as well as the only value possible of that type

A variable that has been declared with `var` but not defined has a value of `undefined`
Weirdly, a variable that has NOT been declared will also give a value of `undefined` when accessed via `typeof`
