There are 2 ways to access a property of an object:
- Using [[Dot Notation (JavaScript)|dot notation]]
- Using [[Bracket Notation (JavaScript)|bracket notation]]

- Accessing a property that does not exist in an object will result in _undefined_.
- If a property name is a number, it has to be accessed via bracket notation
