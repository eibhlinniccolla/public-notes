JavaScript is [[synchronous]] by default, it has no asynchronicity built in. It can't set timers and it can't talk to the internet. In order to do those things, it has to rely on façade APIs provided to JavaScript by the runtime where the code is being executed (i.e. Node or the browser). These façade APIs, such as `setTimeout()`, are **not** a native part of JavaScript and may or may not exist depending on where the code is being executed.
