# What is semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML refers to the practice of writing HTML in such a way that the purpose and meaning of each piece of content is conveyed by the structure of the document itself. A semantically written piece of HTML is structured based on meaning, and a strict separation is maintained between the structure of the markup and the appearance of the webpage. This is accomplished by using HTML tags which carry semantic meaning (such as `<p>`, `<article>`, or `<header>`), and by organizing tags in the document in such a way that their meaning and relationship to one another is obvious.

And third, it makes your code easier to read and maintain, since the purpose of each element is clear.
