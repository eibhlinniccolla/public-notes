- Function calls form a stack of _frames_.
- "A stack of calls to functions"
- Special data structure
    - keeps track of what execution context the thread of execution is in at any given time, and what context it will return to
- When the program starts running, the global context is added to the **bottom** of the callstack
- When a new execution context is created it is added to (**pushed** to) the top of the callstack
- The last context added to the callstack is the first one to be removed (**popped** off)
