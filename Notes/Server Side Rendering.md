- How does it work
    - Client sends request to server for page
    - Server renders requested page, and then sends back the rendered page, as well as the compiled bundle
    - After the initial page load, the SPA works as normal
- Initial setup
    - Create `clientapp.js` file
        - replace React.render with hydrate
- `renderToString`
- `renderToNodeStream`
