- JavaScript is not a truly interpreted language
    - It is parsed before execution
        - If you have a syntax error on line 4, lines 1-3 never execute
    - The compiling/parsing step produces an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)
- At compile time, several things occur
    - All scopes are determined
    - All identifiers are declared
    - The scope that each identifier belongs to is determined
    - The position (assignee or source) of each identifier is determined
- Think of the result of the compilation step as a "treasure map" for the JavaScript Virtual Machine executing the code (in this scope, there should be this identifier and it is located here).
    - Compile step: build the treasure map
    - Run step: follow the treasure map and do the stuff the code says to do
