- What is it
	- a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home
	- Comprised of cables, access points, switches, routers, and other components that enable devices to connect to internal servers, web servers, and other LANs via Wide Area Networks.
	- Wide Area Network (WAN) / Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
		- cover larger geographic areas
		- some WANs and MANs connect many LANs together
- Benefits
	- The devices can use a single Internet connection, share files with one another, print to shared printers, and be accessed and even controlled by one another.
- two types
	- client/server LANs
		- consists of several devices (the clients) connected to a central server
		- server manages file storage, application access, device access, and network traffic
		- client can be any connected device that runs or accesses applications or the Internet
		- clients connect to the server either with cables or through wireless connections
	- peer-to-peer LANs
		- doesn't have a central server and cannot handle heavy workloads like a client/server LAN can, and so they're typically smaller
		- each device shares equally in the functioning of the network
		- devices share resources and data through wired or wireless connections to a switch or router
		- Most home networks are peer-to-peer
- virtual LANs
	- enable network administrators to logically group network nodes and partition their networks without a need for major infrastructure changes
