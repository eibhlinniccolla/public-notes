- Block, Element, Modifier
- Differentiate classes that fulfill different roles by naming classes in a way that indicates role.
- Complements OOCSS because OOCSS doesn’t impose any class-naming convention.
- A block is an independent, modular UI component.
    - May be composed of multiple HTML elements, or even multiple blocks.
    - An example of a block might be your navigation menu or search form.
- An element is a component of a block.
    - Serves a singular purpose.
    - If you have a navigation menu block, then elements of it might be your navigation menu’s links, which in turn might be in the form of list items (<li>) and links (<a>).
- A modifier is a CSS class that changes the default presentation of a block or element.
- class-naming syntax:
    - .block
    - .block--modifier
    - .block__element
    - .block__element--modifier
- Naming convention helps authors comply with the OOCSS principle of using a flat selector hierarchy composed of equally-specific class selectors.
- Also helps OOCSS authors avoid deep descendant selectors.
- Criticisms
    - class names can end up being long and ugly
    - not intuitive to inexperienced developers
