4 Layers
	- Link describes the access to physical media (e.g. using the network card)
	- Internet describes the envelope and routing of data â€” how it is packaged (IP)
	- Transport describes the way the data is delivered from the starting point to the final destination (TCP, UDP)
	- Application describes the meaning or format of the transferred messages (HTTP)
- IPv4
	- Traditional IP addresses 32 bits long with 8 bits for each part of the IP address
	- The parts of the IP represent the networks, subnetworks, and device  
		`174.129.14.120  
		network / network / subnetwork / device`
	- No longer viable because of the number of devices on the internet
- IPv6
	- Longer than IPv4
	- 128 bits per address
- Subnet Mask

- How are IP Addresses assigned
	- **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)** is the organization responsible for registering IP address ranges to organizations and Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
	- To allow organizations to freely assign private IP addresses, the **Network Information Center (InterNIC)** has reserved certain address blocks for private use. The following IP blocks are reserved for private IP addresses.
- Public vs. Private IP

	- Public IP
		- IP address that can be accessed over the Internet
		- globally unique IP address assigned to a computing device
	- Private IP
		- allocated by InterNIC to allow organizations to create their own private network
		- There are three IP blocks (1 class A, 1 class B and 1 class C) reserved for a private use.
		- The computers, tablets and smartphones sitting behind your home, and the personal computers within an organizations are usually assigned private IP addresses
		- A network printer residing in your home is assigned a private address so that only your family can print to your local printer.
		- However, the devices residing outside of your local network cannot directly communicate via the private IP address, but uses your router's public IP address to communicate
		- To allow direct access to a local device which is assigned a private IP address, a Network Address Translator (NAT) should be used.
		- used to assign computers within your private space without letting them directly expose to the Internet
		- For example, if you have multiple computers within your home you may want to use private IP addresses to address each computer within your home.
		- In this scenario, your router gets the public IP address, and each of the computers, tablets and smartphones connected to your router (via wired or wifi) gets a private IP address from your router via DHCP protocol.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
	- Manages sending and receiving of data as packets
	- When all packets arrive at destination, TCP does an inventory
	- Sends back acknowledgement of packets received
	- If any packets are missing, the original server resends them
