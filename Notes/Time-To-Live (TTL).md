- a value in a [[DNS record]] that determines the number of seconds before subsequent changes to the record go into effect
- Each DNS record has a TTL value
- changing a record's TTL affects how long it will take any _subsequent_ change to happen
	- The shorter TTL will only take effect after the prior period expires.
- recommended setting is 3600, which tells servers across the Internet to check every hour for updates to the record
- To make subsequent changes happen even more quickly—for example, if you think you might want to quickly revert a change—you can set a shorter TTL, such as 300 seconds (5 minutes).
- Once the records are configured correctly, we recommend setting a TTL value of 86400, which tells servers across the Internet to check every 24 hours for updates to the record.
