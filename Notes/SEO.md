        - ~~Traditional SEO Strategies #project-management/story~~
            - Focus on **unique** and **targeted** content, using relevant keywords and terminology
                - Things that will make you stand out from people using more common keywords
            - Richness of content
                - Including videos and images that increase the level of interaction with the user
                - caveat: it is important to supplement videos and images with text, because we crawlers cannot analyze them to the same degree to determine what your site is about
            - Frequent updates
                - Updating content
                - Updating links
            - Link building
                - You want important sites to link to your URL
            - Keyword stuffing (used to work)
            - Businesses with a physical location
                - Fill out Google My Business page
                - Ask for reviews (Facebook, Google) and display them on your website
                - Submit your business to local directories
                    - Chambers of Commerce
                    - https://moz.com/products/local
                    - Correct errors/outdated information in Local Citations
                    - https://seo.co/local-seo/
                    - Acquire local backlinks - vendors, partners, local NGOs etc
                    - Set specific geographic-targeting in Google Search Console
            - Page Rank
                - The "quality" of a site is proportional to how many other sites link to it
                - A link from a quality site is worth more
                - Links from sites that frequently link to other sites are worth less, and vice versa
                - It's better to have one domain that has many internal links than multiple domains that link to each other
            - "Long Tail" keywords
                - Avoid high-value keywords such as "diamond", "mortgage", "car donation" because there will be a lot of players in those spaces trying to edge each other out
                - Focus on "high intent" keywords
                    - e.g. "learn javascript" vs. "seo metadata video course"
                - account for 70% of all searches
                - because they're higher intent, they're inherently more likely to convert
                - Allows you to filter down to people that know what they want
            - Keyword tools
                - https://www.wordtracker.com/
                - https://www.semrush.com/
                - https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/
                    - Focus on
                        - bids less than $10
                        - low-competition
                        - high avg. monthly searches
                        - more likely to be high-intent/high-conversion

                    - You can use to find up-and-coming terms related to your specialization, good idea to find blog post ideas
                - (Sneaky) You can use paid services to plan your keywords, then instead of paying, scrape their UI for all the keywords into a text file, then stick those keywords into title tags, links, descriptions in pages, etc.
            - Linkbuilding Strategies
                - Create "key pages" for popular products and services on your site
                    - These should be canonical URLs, because links to other URLs with query params and such are counted as separate URLs
                    - Never change these URLs
                    - Over time, more people will link to them, increasing their relevance in the algorithm
                    - A good example is "topic pages" on a blog
                - **Link velocity** is the rate at which a page recieves new links over time
                - Guest posts on quality sites
                - Analyze competitors' link profiles and identify link opportunities
                    - [SpyFu](https://www.spyfu.com/)
                    - Figure out what keywords your competitors are targeting and target those same ones
            - White Hat vs. Black Hat SEO
                - **White Hat SEO** is good for humans
                - **Black Hat SEO** is trying to outsmart the bots
                - Focus on sustainable, organic growth
                - If you are linked to by a black hat site
                    - Contact the owners and ask for the link to be taken down
                    - Disavow bad links using [Google Disavow Tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en) (Last Resort)
                - Eliminate mutual 'link exchange' with other sites by adding `rel="nofollow"`
                    - Informs the crawler that you are not lending credibility to or endorsing the site you're linking to, and it won't be taken into account
                - Remove dead links
                - If you find yourself being targeted by malicious reviewers or competators, take a measured, objective approach to responding to try to take the edge off of how that looks to other visitors to your site
