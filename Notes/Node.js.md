    - Globals
        - `process` - has information about the environment the program is running in
        - `require` - function to find and use modules in the current module
        - `__dirname` - current directory path
        - `module` - information about the current module, methods for making modules consumable
        - `global` - like `window`, the "global" object
    - The Event Loop
        - The event loop keeps running as long as there are event listeners still registered
