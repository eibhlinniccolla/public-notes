- Coercion Situations
    - the `+` operator prefers coercion to strings
        - if at least one of the values is a string, it will try to coerce the other to a string
    - the unary `+` operator coerces to numbers
    - the `-`, `/`, and `*` operators prefer coercion to numbers
    - `!` coerces to booleans
- You can coerce another type to a number using `Number()`
    - `Number('16'); // 16`
