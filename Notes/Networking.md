- Notes
    - ISPs
        - An ISP is a company that manages some special _routers_ that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers
        - the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network
        - The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.
    - Modem
        - _modem_ turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.
    - Firewalls

    - NAT
        - process where a network device, usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer (or group of computers) inside a private network
        - main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use, for both economy and security purposes.
        - most common form of network translation involves a large private network using addresses in a private range

    - Packets
        - Imformation goes from computer to computer in the form of "packets"
        - The route that packets take across the internet depends on a variety of factors and can change over the course of a computer-to-computer conversation
        - Packets can arrive at different times or out of order
        - They are reassembled once they arrive at their destination
        - Each packet contains the IP address of where it came from and where it's going
    - Routers
        - Special computers that act like traffic managers to help make sure that packets get where they need to go
        - Keep track of multiple routes for sending packets and they select the cheapest for each packet based on its destination
        - Multiple routes make it possible to complete transaction even if something goes wrong (_fault tolerance_)

    - LAN (Local Area Network)
        - What is it
            - a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home
            - Comprised of cables, access points, switches, routers, and other components that enable devices to connect to internal servers, web servers, and other LANs via Wide Area Networks.
            - Wide Area Network (WAN) / Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
                - cover larger geographic areas
                - some WANs and MANs connect many LANs together
        - Benefits
            - The devices can use a single Internet connection, share files with one another, print to shared printers, and be accessed and even controlled by one another.
        - two types
            - client/server LANs
                - consists of several devices (the clients) connected to a central server
                - server manages file storage, application access, device access, and network traffic
                - client can be any connected device that runs or accesses applications or the Internet
                - clients connect to the server either with cables or through wireless connections
            - peer-to-peer LANs
                - doesn't have a central server and cannot handle heavy workloads like a client/server LAN can, and so they're typically smaller
                - each device shares equally in the functioning of the network
                - devices share resources and data through wired or wireless connections to a switch or router
                - Most home networks are peer-to-peer
        - virtual LANs
            - enable network administrators to logically group network nodes and partition their networks without a need for major infrastructure changes
    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
        - an application protocol that sits above the communication protocol
        - defined to communicate information between two pieces of software via HTTP messages
        - the HTTP client (browser) is always initiating the request to the HTTP server
        - Request
            - HTTP Headers
                - additional data sent by the user agent to give more context about the transaction going on between the client and the server
                - Methods
                    - `OPTIONS`
                    - `GET`
                    - `HEAD`
                    - `POST`
                    - `PUT`
                    - `DELETE`
                    - `TRACE`
                    - `CONNECT`
            - URIs
                - niquely identify something on the network
        - Response
            - Status Codes
                - `200` - OK
                - `307` - moved temporarily elsewhere
                    - useful when you want to redirect a client to a specific page for a little while
                - `301` - address changed permanently
    - DNS (Domain name system)
        - What is it?
            - Associates URLs with IP addresses
            - Domains
                - A domain name (often simply called a _domain_) is an easy-to-remember name that’s associated with a physical IP address on the Internet
                - Parts
                    - Labels (or components)
                        - Restrictions
                            - case-insensitive
                            - one to sixty-three characters in length
                            - contains only the letters A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and the - character
                        - The label located right before the TLD is also called a _Secondary Level Domain_ (SLD).
                        - A domain name can have many labels (or components). It is not mandatory nor necessary to have 3 labels to form a domain name.
                    - TLD (Top-Level Domain)
                        - `.com`, `.net`, `.org`
                        - tell users the general purpose of the service behind the domain name
                        - The most generic TLDs (.com, .org, .net) don't require web services to meet any particular criteria
                        - some TLDs enforce stricter policies so it is clearer what their purpose is. For example
                            - Local TLDs such as .us, .fr, or .se can require the service to be provided in a given language or hosted in a certain country — they are supposed to indicate a resource in a particular language or country.
                            - TLDs containing .gov are only allowed to be used by government departments.
                            - The .edu TLD is only for use by educational and academic institutions.
                - Registering
                    - You cannot “buy a domain name”.
                        - This is so that unused domain names eventually become available to use again by someone else.
            - Subdomains
                - a domain that's part of a larger domain
                - Domain owners can create subdomains to provide easy-to-remember addresses for web pages or services within their top-level domain
            - "Naked" Domains
                - a domain address without the "www" prefix
            - Domain Registrars
                - a company that sells domain names that aren't yet owned and are therefore available for registration
                - use domain name registries to keep track of technical and administrative information connecting you to your domain name
                - Note : For some domain names, it might not be a registrar which is in charge of keeping track. For instance, every domain name under .fire is managed by Amazon.
            - Domain host
                - A domain host is a company that runs the DNS servers for your domain and manages its DNS records
            - Name server
                - serves as a reference point for your domain’s DNS data
                - typically maintained by a domain host company
                - Some countries require that name servers reside on different IP networks for reliability
                - Each name server must return identical records for your domain.
                - The order in which your records are returned doesn’t matter.
            - WHOIS directory
                - public listing of domain names, and the people or organizations associated with each name
                - some domain name owners prefer to have their personal information hidden from the WHOIS directory
                - There are many free web-based directories available on the Internet.
                - mailing address and a telephone number
            - DNS refreshing
                - DNS databases are stored on every DNS server worldwide, and all these servers refer to a few special servers called “authoritative name servers” or “top-level DNS servers.” — these are like the boss servers that manage the system.
                - Whenever your registrar creates or updates any information for a given domain, the information must be refreshed in every DNS database. Each DNS server that knows about a given domain stores the information for some time before it is automatically invalidated and then refreshed (the DNS server queries an authoritative server and fetches the updated information from it). Thus, it takes some time for DNS servers that know about this domain name to get the up-to-date information.
            - How does a DNS request work?
                - You type a URL in your browser's location bar.
                - Your browser asks your computer if it already recognizes the IP address identified by this domain name (using a local DNS cache). If it does, the name is translated to the IP address and the browser negotiates contents with the web server. End of story.
                - If your computer does not know which IP is behind the mozilla.org name, it goes on to ask a DNS server, whose job is precisely to tell your computer which IP address matches each registered domain name.
                - Now that the computer knows the requested IP address, your browser can negotiate contents with the web server.
        - Why was it created?
            - Created to be an open and public communication protocol for government and educational institutions
        - How is it organized?
            - DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy
                - Divided into zones splitting up responsibility for major domains (.com, .net, .org)
        - DNS Records
            - Types of records
                - CNAME (Canonical Name) Records
                    - links an alias name to another true or _canonical_ domain name
                        - _www.example.com_ might link to _example.com_
                    - Format
                        - The canonical representation is:
                            - `CNAME <domain-name>`
                            - where `<domain-name>` is a fully-qualified domain name such as example.com.
                    - Restrictions
                        - A CNAME record must always point to another domain name, never directly to an IP address.
                        - A CNAME record cannot co-exist with another record for the same name. It’s not possible to have both a CNAME and TXT record for www.example.com.
                        - A CNAME can point to another CNAME, although this configuration is generally not recommended for performance reasons.
                            - When applicable, the CNAME should point as closely as possible to the target name in order to avoid unnecessary performance overheads.
                    - CNAME vs. HTTP redirect
                        - The CNAME record is sometimes improperly referred to as _redirect_, generally in the context of web (HTTP) redirects.
                        - There is no direct correlation between a CNAME and an HTTP redirect, nor does configuring CNAME automatically result in any HTTP redirect.
                        - In order to perform an HTTP redirect, the server responding to the HTTP request must be configured to return an appropriate HTTP response. This is not directly achievable using a CNAME.
                    - CNAME records are typically used to map a subdomain such as _www_ or _mail_ to the domain hosting that subdomain’s content
                    - CNAME records make it easy to run multiple services from one IP address
                    - Each CNAME record associates a service with a domain name, not a physical IP address.
                        - The physical IP address is instead identified by your domain's A record
                        - If your IP address changes, you only have to change the A record, not each CNAME record.
                    - stored in your domain’s DNS settings as a pair of values
                        - one value identifies the alias you're creating the record for, which is typically a subdomain like _www_ or _mail_.
                        - other value identifies the domain the alias should point to.
                - A (Address) Records
                    - (also known as a host record)
                    - links a domain to the physical IP address of a computer hosting that domain's services
                    - Internet traffic uses the A record to find the computer hosting your domain's DNS settings
                    - The value of an A record is always an IP address
                    - multiple A records can be configured for one domain name
                    - A Records are the simplest type of DNS records, and one of the primary records used in DNS servers.
                    - You can use multiple A records for the same domain in order to provide redundancy
                    - multiple names could point to the same address, in which case each would have its own A record pointing to that same IP address
                    - Format
                        - The structure of an A record follows the standard top-level format definition defined [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.1). The RDATA section is composed of one single element:
                        - The canonical representation is:
                            - `A <address>`
                            - address - A 32 bit Internet address representing an IPv4 address
                - NS (Name Service) Records
                    - determine which servers will communicate DNS information for a domain
                    - Generally, you have primary and secondary name server records for your domain
                    - delegates a subdomain to a set of name servers
                - MX (Mail eXchange) Records
                    - direct a domain's email to the servers hosting the domain's user accounts
                    - Multiple MX records can be defined for a domain, each with a different priority.
                        - If mail can't be delivered using the highest priority record, the second priority record is used, and so on.
                - TXT Records
                    - provides text information to sources outside the domain
                        - can be used for a number of arbitrary purposes
                        - can be either human- or machine-readable text
            - TTL (Time to Live
                - a value in a DNS record that determines the number of seconds before subsequent changes to the record go into effect
                - Each DNS record has a TTL value
                - changing a record's TTL affects how long it will take any _subsequent_ change to happen
                    - The shorter TTL will only take effect after the prior period expires.
                - recommended setting is 3600, which tells servers across the Internet to check every hour for updates to the record
                - To make subsequent changes happen even more quickly—for example, if you think you might want to quickly revert a change—you can set a shorter TTL, such as 300 seconds (5 minutes).
                - Once the records are configured correctly, we recommend setting a TTL value of 86400, which tells servers across the Internet to check every 24 hours for updates to the record.
            - Querying DNS Records
                - You can use `dig` to determine the record associated to a domain name.
                    - The result is contained in the ANSWER section. It contains the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), the remaining time-to-live (TTL), and the IP address.
        - DNS Spoofing
            - When a hacker changes a DNS server to match a domain name with the incorrect IP address
        - Gateways
            - network device (a router or firewall, server, any network device which allows to and from traffic)
            - acts as a gateway between two networks ( internal and external network)
            - The specific address given on the router is called default gateway
            - where my network request is routed when the destination IP is outside my subnet
            - The DNS is where all requests to translate a host name to an ip address are sent if they cannot be resolved by the local hosts file
            - This hostname to ip address mapping is one of the first steps that must be completed prior to any network communication with another host.
            - Basically, it represents the interface address of your router, which helps it communicate with IP networks. No gateway, no DNS server access for your computer. Simple as that.
    - TCP/IP (Internet Protocol)
        - 4 Layers
            - Link describes the access to physical media (e.g. using the network card)
            - Internet describes the envelope and routing of data — how it is packaged (IP)
            - Transport describes the way the data is delivered from the starting point to the final destination (TCP, UDP)
            - Application describes the meaning or format of the transferred messages (HTTP)
        - IPv4
            - Traditional IP addresses 32 bits long with 8 bits for each part of the IP address
            - The parts of the IP represent the networks, subnetworks, and device  
                `174.129.14.120  
                network / network / subnetwork / device`
            - No longer viable because of the number of devices on the internet
        - IPv6
            - Longer than IPv4
            - 128 bits per address
        - Subnet Mask

            - https://superuser.com/questions/1163565/what-does-a-forward-slash-followed-by-a-number-mean-in-ip
        - How are IP Addresses assigned
            - **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)** is the organization responsible for registering IP address ranges to organizations and Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
            - To allow organizations to freely assign private IP addresses, the **Network Information Center (InterNIC)** has reserved certain address blocks for private use. The following IP blocks are reserved for private IP addresses.
        - Public vs. Private IP
            - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-private-and-public-ip-addresses/
            - https://whatismyipaddress.com/private-ip
            - Public IP
                - IP address that can be accessed over the Internet
                - globally unique IP address assigned to a computing device
            - Private IP
                - allocated by InterNIC to allow organizations to create their own private network
                - There are three IP blocks (1 class A, 1 class B and 1 class C) reserved for a private use.
                - The computers, tablets and smartphones sitting behind your home, and the personal computers within an organizations are usually assigned private IP addresses
                - A network printer residing in your home is assigned a private address so that only your family can print to your local printer.
                - However, the devices residing outside of your local network cannot directly communicate via the private IP address, but uses your router's public IP address to communicate
                - To allow direct access to a local device which is assigned a private IP address, a Network Address Translator (NAT) should be used.
                - used to assign computers within your private space without letting them directly expose to the Internet
                - For example, if you have multiple computers within your home you may want to use private IP addresses to address each computer within your home.
                - In this scenario, your router gets the public IP address, and each of the computers, tablets and smartphones connected to your router (via wired or wifi) gets a private IP address from your router via DHCP protocol.
        - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
            - Manages sending and receiving of data as packets
            - When all packets arrive at destination, TCP does an inventory
            - Sends back acknowledgement of packets received
            - If any packets are missing, the original server resends them
