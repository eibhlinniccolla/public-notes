- Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS
- Five categories:
    - Base
        - Rules that set the default CSS properties of individual HTML elements.
        - Typically CSS type selectors.
    - Layout
        - Style rules that are related to the structural layout of web pages.
        - Containers, the grid, etc.
        - They are prefixed with layout- or l-.
    - Modules
        - Modular, reusable components.
    - State
        - Style rules that specify the current state of something in the interface.
    - Themes
        - Style rules that affect layout and modules, triggered by user preferences/actions/viewing contexts.
- Offers a simpler naming convention than BEM.
- There are no names for base styles because only type selectors (h1, p, a, etc.) are used for those.
- Modules are given their own unique class names.
- Sub-components and variations are prefixed with the name of their parent module.
- SMACSS discourages the use of descendant selectors.
    - Depth of applicability.
        - This concept is all about limiting the impact that CSS has on HTML markup by using classes to very precisely target elements you want to style.
