- Imformation goes from computer to computer in the form of "packets"
- The route that packets take across the internet depends on a variety of factors and can change over the course of a computer-to-computer conversation
- Packets can arrive at different times or out of order
- They are reassembled once they arrive at their destination
- Each packet contains the IP address of where it came from and where it's going
