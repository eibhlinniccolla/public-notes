- ES2015
    - Tagged literals
        - Applies a function to template string when expression is evaluated
        - Tag Function
            - First argument is array of strings found in template string
            - The rest of the arguments are the values to be interpolated (can be collected into an array using `...`)
            - Returns final string to be returned from expression
            - There will ALWAYS be one more item in strings array than list of values
                - Even if extra value needs to be empty string
                - This ensures values values are always sandwiched between two strings
            - Example: Format Currency  
                ```function formatCurrency (strings, ...values) {  
                var str = "";  
                for (let i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {  
                if (i > 0) { // because there is always a string before first value  
                if (typeof values[i - 1] == "number") {  
                str += '$' + values[i - 1].toFixed(2);  
                } else {  
                str += values[i - 1];  
                }  
                }  
                str += strings[i];  
                }  
                return str;  
                }```  
                
            - Doesn't HAVE to return a string either
                - Can return a regular expression from a parsed multiline string
                - Can return a DOM object from parsed JSX
                - GraphQL query
    - `class`
        - `class` vs. pre-ES2015 constructor functions
            - Syntactic sugar for the JavaScript prototype system
            - JavaScript "classes" and classes in other languages do NOT work the same!!
            - Absolutely nothing changes under the hood. `class` simply abstracts and automates what we had to do manually before.
        - `constructor`
            - Corresponds to the "function" part of the pre-ES2015 constructor functions
                - Before:  
                    ```  
                    function User (name, age) {  
                    this.name = name;  
                    this.age = age;  
                    }  
                    ```
                - After:  
                    ```  
                    class User {  
                    constructor (name, age) {  
                    this.name = name;  
                    this.age = age;  
                    }  
                    }  
                    ```
            - The `constructor` method is run automatically when you invoke the class with the `new` keyword.
        - methods
            - Correspond to the "object" part of the pre-ES2015 constructor functions
                - Before:  
                    ```  
                    function User () {}  
                      
                    User.prototype.sayName = function () {  
                    console.log(this.name);  
                    }  
                    ```
                - After:  
                    ```  
                    class User {  
                    sayName () {  
                    console.log(this.name);  
                    }  
                    }  
                    ```
        - `static`
            - Defines a static method or property
            - Adds that property/method to the class object itself, instead of its `.prototype` object
            - Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class.
            - Static methods are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects
            - static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances.
            - In order to call a static method or property within another static method of the same class, you can use the `this` keyword.
            - Static members are not directly accessible using the `this` keyword from non-static methods.
                - You need to call them using the class name, or by calling the method as a property of the constructor
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    class User {  
                    constructor () {  
                    User.someProperty; // 42  
                    User.someMethod(); // Hello world  
                      
                    this.constructor.someProperty; // 42  
                    this.constructor.someMethod(); // Hello world  
                    }  
                      
                    static someProperty = 42;  
                    static someMethod () { return "Hello world"; }  
                    }  
                    ```
        - `extends`
            - sets the `[[prototype]]` of the **child** class's (constructor function's) `.prototype` object to the `.prototype` object of the parent class('s constructor function)
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    class Parent {}  
                      
                    class Child extends Parent {}  
                      
                    Object.getPrototypeOf(Child.constructor) === Parent.constructor.prototype; // true  
                    ```
            - sets the `[[prototype]]` of the child class (the class function itself, not the constructor method) to the parent class (again, the class itself, not the constructor method)
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    class Parent {}  
                      
                    class Child extends Parent {}  
                      
                    Object.getPrototypeOf(Child) === Parent; // true  
                    ```
        - `this` inside a child class
            - As opposed to a parent class, or a pre-ES2015 style constructor function, the `this` identifier inside the constructor a class that `extends` another class is NOT initialized automatically by the `new` keyword with an empty object
            - You CANNOT refer to `this` inside a child `constructor` method before calling `super`
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    class Parent {  
                    constructor (name) {  
                    this.name = name;  
                    }  
                    }  
                      
                    class Child extends Parent {  
                    constructor (name, age) {  
                    this.age = age;  
                    }  
                    }  
                      
                    var child = new Child("Eileen", 27); // ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor  
                      
                    ```
            - This is because the object that the child `this` will refer to is created inside the **parent** `constructor` method
        - `super`
            - `super` causes `this` to behave slightly differently
                - Sets the **parent's** constructor's `this` value to an empty object whose `[[prototype]]` value is set to the **child** constructor's `.prototype` property
                - Executes the **parent's** constructor function
                - Once the parent's constructor function returns, this newly created object (with any properties added by the parent's constructor) is set as the `this` value of the **child** constructor function
            - If the subclass has an empty constructor, you can omit it entirely and `super()` will automatically be called with the arguments passed to the child constructor
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    class User {  
                    constructor (name) {  
                    this.name = name;  
                    }  
                    }  
                      
                    class Student extends User {}  
                      
                    var eileen = new Student("Eileen");  
                      
                    eileen.name; // Eileen  
                    ```
            - You can use `super` to call methods on the parent class from the child class
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    class Animal {  
                    constructor (species) {  
                    this.species = species;  
                    }  
                    makeSound () {  
                    return `The ${this.species} says...`;  
                    }  
                    }  
                      
                    class Dog extends Animal {  
                    constructor () { super("dog"); }  
                    makeSound () {  
                    return super.makeSound() + "Woof!";  
                    }  
                    }  
                      
                    var corgi = new Dog();  
                    corgi.makeSound(); // "The dog says...Woof!"  
                    ```
        - `Reflect.construct()`
            - Under the hood, using the `super` keyword is equivalent to running `Reflect.construct()` with specific arguments
            - The static Reflect.construct() method acts like the `new` operator, but as a function.
                - It is equivalent to calling `new target(...args)`.
                - It gives also the added option to specify a different `[[prototype]]`.
            - Comparison with `super`
                - this:  
                    ```  
                    class Parent {  
                    constructor (name) {  
                    this.name = name;  
                    }  
                      
                    sayName () {  
                    console.log(this.name);  
                    }  
                    }  
                      
                    class Child extends Parent {  
                    constructor (name, age) {  
                    super(name);  
                    this.age = age;  
                    }  
                      
                    sayAge () {  
                    console.log(this.age);  
                    }  
                    }  
                      
                    var eileen = new Child("Eileen", 27);  
                      
                    eileen.sayName(); // Eileen  
                    eileen.sayAge(); // 27  
                    ```
                - is equivalent to this:  
                    ```  
                    function Parent (name) {  
                    this.name = name;  
                    }  
                      
                    Parent.prototype.sayName = function () {  
                    console.log(this.name);  
                    };  
                      
                    function Child (name, age) {  
                    var obj = Reflect.construct(  
                    Parent,  
                    [name],  
                    Child  
                    );  
                    obj.age = age;  
                    return obj;  
                    }  
                      
                    Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);  
                      
                    Child.prototype.sayAge = function () {  
                    console.log(this.age);  
                    };  
                      
                    var eileen = Child("Eileen", 27);  
                      
                    eileen.sayName(); // Eileen  
                    eileen.sayAge(); // 27  
                    ```
        - Example:  
            ```  
            class User {  
            constructor (name) {  
            this.name = name;  
            }  
              
            sayName() {  
            console.log(this.name);  
            }  
            }  
              
            class PaidUser extends User {  
            constructor (name, balance) {  
            super(name);  
            this.balance = balance;  
            }  
              
            addBalance(balanceToAdd) {  
            this.balance += balanceToAdd;  
            }  
            }  
              
            var paidUser = new PaidUser("Eileen", 0);  
              
            paidUser.sayName(); // "Eileen"  
            paidUser.addBalance(50);  
            console.log(paidUser.balance); // 50  
            ```  
            
    - Destructuring
        - What is destructuring
            - Destructuring is **de**composing a **structure** into its component parts
            - The purpose of destructuring is to **assign** individual parts from some larger structure to other locations
            - A more declarative method for assigning parts of a data structure to variables
        - Why use destructuring
            - You can tell just by looking at the destructuring pattern what the response looks like, and the parts we care about
                - Code is more self-documenting
            - Basically says, hey JS, this is what I'm expecting back, get me these parts and assign them to these variables
            - Example:  
                `var [{  
                name: firstName,  
                email: firstEmail = "none@empty.com"  
                }, {  
                name: secondName,  
                email: secondEmail = "none@empty.com"  
                }] = someApiCall();`
        - Assignment
            - Default values
                - Setting default values ONLY works if the value ends up being `undefined`
                    - A default value will NOT be applied in the case of the value `null`
            - Reference to destructured object
                - If you want a reference to the entire data structure, you can add another variable declaration before the destructuring pattern, then chain assignment operators  
                    `var arr;  
                    var [  
                    first,  
                    second,  
                    third  
                    } = arr = data();`
                    - Note that the assignment can be in any order, but the identifiers will always be assigned the entire value that was subject to assignment  
                        `  
                        var nums = [1,2,3,4,5];  
                          
                        var arr;  
                        var temp;  
                        temp = [ // temp still ends up being the entire array, not just 1 and 2;  
                        arr[0],  
                        arr[1]  
                        } = nums;`
            - Any valid left-hand-side target can be the target of a destructuring statement  
                `var o = {};  
                var arr = [];  
                [  
                o.first,  
                arr[1],  
                o["key"]  
                } = data();`
            - Assignment and declaration can be done separately in destructuring. Destructuring is about assignment, not declaration  
                `var first, second, third;  
                [  
                first,  
                second,  
                third  
                } = data();`
        - Array Destructuring
            - In array destructuring, you cannot destructure values that are not arrays. You'll get a typeError just like you would if you were using an imperative style  
                `var nums = null;  
                  
                var [first, second, third] = nums; // TypeError, cannot access [0] of null`
                - To avoid this, always provide a fallback  
                    `var nums = null;  
                      
                    var [first = 10, second = 20, third] = nums || []; // no TypeError  
                      
                    function ([ first = 10, second = 20, third] = []) {} // also no TypeError`
            - You can skip an index in a destructured array (array elision) by simply having nothing between the commas.  
                `var nums = [1,2,3,4,5];  
                  
                var arr = [];  
                [  
                arr[0], // 1  
                arr[1], // 2  
                , // no assignment occurs  
                ...arr[2] // [4, 5]  
                } = nums;`
                - Useful if there are items you want to skip before a rest operator
            - Destructuring can also be used to swap values  
                `var x = 10;  
                var y = 20;  
                  
                [x, y] = [y, x];`
            - You can destructure nested arrays just like flat arrays  
                `var nums = [ 1, [ 2, 3 ], 4 ];  
                  
                var [  
                first,  
                [  
                second,  
                third  
                ] = [],  
                fourth  
                ] = nums || [];`
        - Object Destructuring
            - just like with array destructuring, you can collect any remaining properties in a new object by using the rest operator  
                `var obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };  
                var {  
                a: first, // 1  
                b: second, // 2  
                ...third // { c: 3, d: 4 }  
                } = obj;`
            - When you are assigning to only existing variables in object destructuring, you need to wrap the entire statement in parentheses so JS doesn't think it's a block  
                `var obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };  
                var x, y;  
                  
                ({  
                a: x,  
                b: y  
                } = obj);`
                - Note: this is NOT the case if you have anything in front of the curly brace, such as a declarator or a chained assignment operator  
                    `var obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };  
                    var x, y, tmp;  
                      
                    tmp = { // No parens needed  
                    a: x,  
                    b: y  
                    } = obj;`
            - Just like with nested arrays, you can destructure nested objects  
                `obj = {  
                a: 1,  
                b: 2,  
                c: {  
                d: 3,  
                }  
                };  
                  
                var {  
                a,  
                b,  
                c: {  
                d  
                } = {}  
                } = obj;`
            - You can list the same property more than once to assign it to different places or in different ways  
                `var user = {  
                name: "eileen",  
                address: {  
                street: "123 example street",  
                city: "Des Moines"  
                }  
                };  
                  
                var {  
                name,  
                address: {  
                street,  
                city  
                },  
                address  
                } = user;`
                - This is useful when you have a nested property you want to destructure while retaining a reference to its parent
            - You can use object destructuring to imitate "named parameters" which don't exist in JavaScript  
                `function getStudent ({ id = null, school = "North Cedar" } {  
                // ...  
                }  
                  
                getStudent({ id: 1, school: "Wartburg"}); // args can go in any order`
                - This allows you to disregard order when it comes to passing arguments to a function
                - A good rule of thumb is to used named parameters if your function takes more than 3 parameters
    - Array Methods
        - flatMap
            - returning an array with items in it has the effect of adding an item to the array, while returning an empty array has the effect of removing the mapped value from the array  
                `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ].flatMap(function doubleEvens (val) {  
                return val % 2 == 0 ? [val, val * 2] : [];  
                }); // [ 2, 4, 4, 8, 6, 12 ]`
    - Iterators & Generators
        - Iterators
            - What is an iterator
                - An object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination
                - Takes an **iterable** data source and returns on object which allows you to iterate over the values in the data source one at a time.
                - Iterators allow us to think of arrays/lists as "streams" of data by automating the process of accessing each element
                - Implements the [Iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol)
                    - has a `next()` method which returns an object with two properties:
                        - `value`: the next value in the sequence
                        - `done`: `true` if the last value in the sequence has already been consumed.
                        - If value is present alongside done, it is the iterator's return value.
                    - The iterator protocol only supports iterating forward
            - How to construct an iterator  
                `var str = "Hello";  
                var it = str[Symbol.iterator]();  
                it.next(); // { value: "H", done: false }`
            - You can keep calling done after the data source has been completely iterated over, but it will just keep returning `{value: undefined, done: true }`
                - It won't throw an error
            - `for ... of` loops
                - You can iterate over the values of an iterator **OR** an iterable value by using a `for ... of` loop  
                    `var str = "Hello";  
                    for (let val of str) {  
                    console.log(val);  
                    }`
            - _spread_ operator
                - An alternative to a `for ... of` loop is to use the `...` (spread) operator to create an array from an iterator or iterable value's items  
                    `var str = "Hello";  
                    var letters = [...str];`
                - The `...` operator consumes an iterator
            - Objects do not have iterators
                - This means that if you try to use a `for ... of` loop on an object, you will get a `TypeError`
                    - An object's `[Symbol.iterator]` position is `undefined`, which when executed as a function will give you the `TypeError`
                - You can ADD an iterator to any object by providing a factory function at its `[Symbol.iterator]` position  
                    `var obj = {  
                    a: 1,  
                    b: 2,  
                    c: 3,  
                    [Symbol.iterator]: function () {  
                    var keys = Object.keys(this);  
                    var index = 0;  
                    return {  
                    next: () => {  
                    (index < keys.length) ?  
                    { done: false, value: this[keys[index++]] } :  
                    { done: true, value: undefined }  
                    }  
                    }  
                    };  
                      
                    [...obj]; // [1,2,3]`
                - If you have a custom data structure which exposes an iterator which implements the iterator protocol, you can iterate over it using both of the above methods without writing any extra code
        - Generators
            - What is a generator
                - A function marked by an `*` before its name
                - a more declarative way to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function whose execution is not continuous.
                - When called initially, generator functions do not execute any of their code, instead returning a type of iterator called a Generator.
                - When a value is consumed by calling the generator's `next` method, the Generator function executes until it encounters the `yield` keyword.
            - Suspending execution
                - "Pausing" execution is possible because the iterator generated from calling a generator function retains a reference to both its closure via the `[[scope]]` property, but also the line of code where execution was suspended via the `[[generatorLocation]]` property
                - ![Screen Shot 2022-02-01 at 1.16.38 PM.png](https://dynalist.io/u/W0d1PYFIQaoVBfRpsNX1rAJ3)
            - `yield` vs. `return`
                - In a generator, the value returned by the `return` keyword won't be preserved. The iterator protocol assumes that when it sees a `done: true` that it has iterated past the end of the iteratable values
                - This is why it's considered bad practice to return something from a generator.
                - If you want to keep a value emitted from an iterator, you should always use the `yield` keyword
            - Passing a value to `.next()`
                - Whatever value is passed as an argument to a generator's `.next()` function is used as the evaluated result of the previous `yield` expression
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    function *myGenerator () {  
                    var num = yield 10;  
                    yield 5 + num;  
                    yield 6;  
                    }  
                      
                    var iterator = myGenerator();  
                    iterator.next(2); // 10  
                    iterator.next(5); // 7  
                    iterator.next(); // 6  
                    ```
                    - After the first `yield` statement, execution is suspended on the right hand side of the variable `num`'s assignment expression
                    - This means that after calling `.next()` for the first time, `num` is still undefined
                    - Because we passed in a value of `2` to the first `.next()` call, when we call `.next()` again and execution resumes where it left off, the `yield` expression is replaced by the value we passed in (`2` in this case) which means that `num` is now assigned the value `2`
                    - On the next line, we yield `5` plus the value of `num`, which now has the value `2`, thus the final `yield`ed value is `7`
                    - Since we also passed in a value to the second call to `.next()`, this is also true when we resume execution after the third call to `.next()`
                    - As before, the previous `yield` expression is replaced with the passed in value, `5` in this case
                    - However, although the expression is evaluated, we don't do anything with it, so it is essentially ignored.
                    - So, on the next line, we still `yield` the expected value of 6
            - `yield`ing a promise
                - Promises are treated the same as any other value when they are `yield`ed
                - Example:  
                    ```  
                    function *myGenerator () {  
                    var data = yield fetch("https://someAPI.com/message")  
                    console.log(data);  
                    }  
                      
                    function onDataReceived (data) {  
                    iterator.next(data);  
                    }  
                      
                    var iterator = myGenerator();  
                      
                    var yieldedPromise = iterator.next();  
                    yieldedPromise.then(onDataReceived);  
                    ```
                    - First an iterator is created by calling the `myGenerator` function
                    - Upon calling its `.next()` method, a promise is `yield`ed, and execution is suspended on the right-hand side of the variable `data`'s assignment expression
                    - This means that right now, `data` is undefined
                    - The `yield`ed promise is stored in `yieldedPromise`
                    - We call `yieldedPromise`'s `.then()` method and add `onDataReceived()` as a callback for when the promise resolves
                    - When the http request comes back, and the promise is resolved, `onDataReceived()` is called with the message passed as an argument
                    - Inside `onDataReceived()`, we call the iterator's `.next()` method, passing in the argument `data` that we received from the promise (i.e. the message we got back from the api)
                    - Execution resumes inside of `*myGenerator` on the right-hand side of `data`'s assignment expression
                    - The previous `yield` expression is replaced with the argument we passed to `iterator.next()` (i.e. the message we got back from the api)
                    - The message is then logged on the next line
            - You can use a `for ... of` loop to `yield` values dynamically
                - Example:  
                    `var obj = {  
                    a: 1,  
                    b: 2,  
                    c: 3,  
                    *[Symbol.iterator]() {  
                    for (let key of Object.keys(this)) {  
                    yield this[key];  
                    }  
                    }  
                    };  
                      
                    var arr = [ ...obj ]; // [1, 2, 3]`
            - You can create a custom generator function by adding a method to an object with a `*` before its name
                - Example:  
                    `var obj = {  
                    a: 1,  
                    b: 2,  
                    c: 3,  
                    *entries() {  
                    for (let key of Object.keys(this)) {  
                    if (typeof this[key] != "function" ) {  
                    yield [key, this[key]]  
                    }  
                    }  
                    }  
                    };`
