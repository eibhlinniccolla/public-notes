# Welcome! Fàilte! Bienvenue!

If you're reading this you probably know who I am already, but I'll introduce myself regardless. My name is Eibhlín NicColla. I'm a software engineer, Gaelic and French learner, and beer snob. I've been writing code for over 7 years now, working primarily with startups and small businesses building SaaS apps and websites.

## About these notes

These notes are not a blog or wiki. These are my real, actual notes I use every day for learning and teaching software development, and they cover everything from basic JavaScript fundamentals to oddball corner cases I've only encountered once or twice in the wild. As such, they're not designed to be a static resource for learning web development from scratch; they're a living, constantly evolving document of my software development knowledge. I've structured them in a way that makes sense to me, and which makes it easy for me to find exactly what I'm looking for when I need it.

While I hope that you may get some use out of my notes (after all, that's why I made them public), they are first and foremost for my own use and I am not interested in requests or critiques. That said, you are free to copy, modify, and distribute any of the content available in these notes freely and without permission. If you do find them useful, I'd love to hear from you!
